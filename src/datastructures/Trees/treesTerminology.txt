full        :   every node points to zero nodes or two nodes
perfect     :   full + symmetrical
complete    :   perfect or perfect + filling the nodes from left to right

Parent and child nodes
If a node has more than one parent it is not a tree

What is tree?
non-linear ds, consists of nodes and each node contains two pointers - left and right
- it can be either value or null

common types of tree
1.BT    - Binary tree
2.BST   - Binary Search tree
3.AVL   - Adelson-Velsky and Landis
4.B     - Special type of self-balancing tree can have more than 2 children

A binary search tree is optimised for finding a node in the tree O(log n){Worst : O(n) - if the tree look like LL } where the elements are arranged in a way
left node = lesser than the parent
right node = greater than the parent
